The user selects what service they want (they have to login to do that so we force them to, if they are not a user, they can register). The selected services will then be processed and the price will be calculated.  For confirmation, we will ask the user if they want to continue or not with the services. the result will then be stored into database. The admin/parlor will check the request of services, probably contact them if any queries. Then the admin/parlor will either confirm or deny the request for the service. At the end, the user will be notified about their request of service being approved or denied. The project was done using a template.
